<h2> Description </h2>

<p>
Provenance is metadata describing the creation, modification history,
ownership, and other influences of data.  Traditionally, provenance
information has been used in database and scientific computation
settings, where it is essential for characterizing the quality,
integrity, and authenticity of data.  More recently, it has been
applied to a number of new areas including probabilistic databases,
synchronization, annotation propagation, version control, and
archiving.  Yet while good practical work is being done in a growing
number of areas, no cross-cutting, foundational studies of provenance
have been undertaken.  We believe the time is ripe for such studies,
and are organizing a workshop to bring together researchers with
interests in this area and to address questions such as:

<ul>
   <li> What does it mean for information to be "provenance"?</li>

   <li> What kinds of problems does provenance address, and how does one
     characterize correct solutions?</li>

   <li> How does one compare different models of provenance?</li>

   <li> Why is provenance so hard to get right, even though it seems
     rather obvious?</li>

   <li> Where should research efforts be focused to make the best
     progress?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="john">Provenance and copyright: Some practical problems</a></h3>
<i>John Ockerbloom</i>
<p>
As information seekers increasingly move from print to digital media,
print resources are being digitized, both by nonprofit libraries
and for-profit companies like Google and Microsoft, at an ever-accelerating
rate.  Increasingly, the force that most tightly constrains the process
for many of the most important research sources is not the cost or complexity
of the digitization itself, but the cost and complexity of clearing
copyrights.  For material less than 100 years old, clearing copyright
can involve establishing a complex and tricky provenance chain for a work,
its publication, its registration, its derivative sources, its authorship,
and its ownership.  Moreover, to clear copyrights at high volume with low risk,
it is important to be able to quickly and automatically identify relevant
factual assertions deriving from reliable sources.  My talk will informally
review some of the provenance-related issues and challenges in clearing
copyrights at large scale, discuss some current work and proposals
to more efficiently gather and share copyright information, and
provide useful examples for applying principles of provenance.

<h3><a name="bertram">A Quick Tour through the Provenance Zoo</a></h3>
<i>Bertram Ludaescher (UC Davis)</i>
<p>
The term 'provenance' has become increasingly popular in a number of
foundational and applied computer science areas, in particular in
databases, scientific workflows, and Grid computing.  
(About twenty years ago, as object-orientation became increasingly
popular, the phrase "my cat is object-oriented" was coined.  
Today we might add, "my cat does provenance", emphasizing that it has
become an activity to be engaged in and excited about, as opposed to a
boring static property -- of course every cat *has* provenance.)
<p>
We first give a brief overview of what people sometimes mean by
provenance in the context of scientific workflows, e.g. some
distinguish 'data provenance', 'workflow provenance', 'process
provenance', etc.  We then present a view of (data) provenance as an
approximation (and/or augmentation) of a processing history according
to a model of computation (MoC). In our view, a model of provenance
(MoP) approximates a MoC via a set of observables.  Finally, we turn
to some basic research questions and directions, in particular to
provenance modeling and design to support use cases as queries.
<p>
We hope that this workshop can begin to identify basic notions and
characteristics of different types of provenance, thus marking a step
towards a provenance taxonomy which will bring at least some order to
the teaming provenance zoo.

<h3><a name="yi">Data Provenance for Query Result Explanation</a></h3>
<i>Yi Chen</i>
<p>
As more and more information from autonomous web databases becomes
available, query processing over these databases must adapt to deal with
the imprecise nature of user queries as well as the incompleteness of
data due to missing attribute values and schema heterogeneity. In such
scenarios, a query processor begins to acquire the role of a recommender
system. Specifically, in addition to presenting answers which satisfy
the user's query, the query processor is expected to provide highly
relevant answers even though they do not exactly satisfy the query
predicates. In this case, it is important that the query results
recommended by the system are trusted by the user. While query result
explanation is critical in traditional databases, it is even more
critical in order to obtain user trust in the presence of imprecision
and incompleteness. For example, consider a scenario where the user
gives a query that searches for car whose model is Civic, one of the
tuples returned by the system has a null value on model, and another has
a value of Corolla on model. Without an accompanying explanation, the
user would be hard pressed to understand why these are relevant answers
to her query. To provide such explanation, we need to record the
provenance information as how we derive query results and how we rank
them, and design a user-friendly interface for query result explanation.
<p>
I will briefly introduce the QUIC system that handles data
incompleteness and query imprecision during data integration, ranks
answers in the order of their expected relevance to users, and attempts
to explain the relevance of its answers by providing snippets of its
reasoning about query result identification and ranking. Then, I will
discuss several challenges on data provenance that we found in
developing QUIC. 

<h3><a name="greg">Provenance Semirings</a></h3>
<i>Grigoris Karvounarakis (Penn)</i>
<p>
We show that relational algebra calculations for incomplete
databases, probabilistic databases, bag semantics and why-provenance
are particular cases of the same general algorithms involving
semirings. This further suggests a comprehensive provenance representation
that uses semirings of polynomials.

<h3><a name="tj">Provenance in Orchestra</a></h3>
<i>TJ Green (Penn)</i>
<p>
We consider systems for data sharing among heterogeneous peers
related by a network of schema mappings.  Each peer has a locally
controlled and edited database instance, but wants to ask queries
over related data from other peers as well. To achieve this, a
peer's updates propagate along the mappings to the other peers.
However, this <i>update exchange<i> is filtered by <i>trust
conditions</i> -- expressing what data and sources a peer judges to
be authoritative -- which may cause a peer to reject another's
updates.  In order to support such filtering, updates carry <i>provenance</i> information.
<p>
In this talk we present methods for realizing such systems.
Specifically, we extend techniques from data integration, data
exchange, and incremental view maintenance to propagate updates
along mappings and we integrate a novel model for tracking data
provenance, such that curators may filter updates based on trust
conditions over this provenance, as implemented in our
Orchestra prototype system.
