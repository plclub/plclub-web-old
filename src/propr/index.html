<h2> Description </h2>

<p>
Provenance is metadata describing the creation, modification history,
ownership, and other influences of data.  Traditionally, provenance
information has been used in database and scientific computation
settings, where it is essential for characterizing the quality,
integrity, and authenticity of data.  More recently, it has been
applied to a number of new areas including probabilistic databases,
synchronization, annotation propagation, version control, and
archiving.  Yet while good practical work is being done in a growing
number of areas, no cross-cutting, foundational studies of provenance
have been undertaken.  We believe the time is ripe for such studies,
and are organizing a workshop to bring together researchers with
interests in this area and to address questions such as:

<ul>
   <li> What does it mean for information to be "provenance"?</li>

   <li> What kinds of problems does provenance address, and how does one
     characterize correct solutions?</li>

   <li> How does one compare different models of provenance?</li>

   <li> Why is provenance so hard to get right, even though it seems
     rather obvious?</li>

   <li> Where should research efforts be focused to make the best
     progress?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Local Arrangements</h2>

PrOPr will take place on Tuesdsay, 26 June 2007 at the 
<a href="http://www.facilities.upenn.edu/visitUs/">University of
Pennsylvania</a> in the Raisler Lounge, which is located on the second floor of the
<a
href="http://www.facilities.upenn.edu/mapsBldgs/view_map.php3?id=158">Towne
Building</a>. 
<p>
Please contact <a href="mailto:jnfoster@cis.upenn.edu">Nate Foster</a>

<h2><a name="program">Program</a></h2>

Each session will alternate between short (12 minute)
presentations and discussion.

<h3><a name="john">Provenance and copyright: Some practical problems</a></h3>
<i>John Ockerbloom</i>
<p>
As information seekers increasingly move from print to digital media,
print resources are being digitized, both by nonprofit libraries
and for-profit companies like Google and Microsoft, at an ever-accelerating
rate.  Increasingly, the force that most tightly constrains the process
for many of the most important research sources is not the cost or complexity
of the digitization itself, but the cost and complexity of clearing
copyrights.  For material less than 100 years old, clearing copyright
can involve establishing a complex and tricky provenance chain for a work,
its publication, its registration, its derivative sources, its authorship,
and its ownership.  Moreover, to clear copyrights at high volume with low risk,
it is important to be able to quickly and automatically identify relevant
factual assertions deriving from reliable sources.  My talk will informally
review some of the provenance-related issues and challenges in clearing
copyrights at large scale, discuss some current work and proposals
to more efficiently gather and share copyright information, and
provide useful examples for applying principles of provenance.

<h3><a name="yi">Data Provenance for Query Result Explanation</a></h3>
<i>Yi Chen</i>
<p>
As more and more information from autonomous web databases becomes
available, query processing over these databases must adapt to deal with
the imprecise nature of user queries as well as the incompleteness of
data due to missing attribute values and schema heterogeneity. In such
scenarios, a query processor begins to acquire the role of a recommender
system. Specifically, in addition to presenting answers which satisfy
the user's query, the query processor is expected to provide highly
relevant answers even though they do not exactly satisfy the query
predicates. In this case, it is important that the query results
recommended by the system are trusted by the user. While query result
explanation is critical in traditional databases, it is even more
critical in order to obtain user trust in the presence of imprecision
and incompleteness. For example, consider a scenario where the user
gives a query that searches for car whose model is Civic, one of the
tuples returned by the system has a null value on model, and another has
a value of Corolla on model. Without an accompanying explanation, the
user would be hard pressed to understand why these are relevant answers
to her query. To provide such explanation, we need to record the
provenance information as how we derive query results and how we rank
them, and design a user-friendly interface for query result explanation.
<p>
I will briefly introduce the QUIC system that handles data
incompleteness and query imprecision during data integration, ranks
answers in the order of their expected relevance to users, and attempts
to explain the relevance of its answers by providing snippets of its
reasoning about query result identification and ranking. Then, I will
discuss several challenges on data provenance that we found in
developing QUIC. 

<h3><a name="mengmeng">Recursive Views Over Streams</a></h3>
<i>Mengmeng Liu</i>
<p>
Traditionally, materialized views in relational and deductive
database systems can be maintained through incremental evaluation
algorithms such as Counting and DRed proposed by Gupta, Mumick,
and Subrahmanian(1993). Normally a view is a derived(idb) relation
defined in terms of base(edb) relations, and the
changes(insertions, deletions and replacements) to the edb
relations can change the view. In some cases, datalog views may be
recursive. The Counting algorithm works for non-recursive views by
tracking the number of alternative derivations(counts) for each
idb in the view. However, for recursive views, an alternative of
Counting algorithm, DRed must be used: it deletes and rederives
tuples to maintain the correct semantics.
<p>
Both non-recursive and recursive views can be more efficiently
maintained by attaching the provenance expression associated with
each tuple. This is because for deletion propagation we can easily
determine which idbs in the view should be deleted. However, in
recursive views, the challenge lies in how to maintain succinct
provenance information: the numbers of provenance items may become
infinitely large with the existence of loops. Here we propose a
variation on provenance semirings formalism proposed by Green,
Karvounarakis and Tannen (2007), which exploits boolean absorption
to make the process more efficient. Our method doesn't keep the
whole provenance information but maintains necessarily succinct
provenance expression for recursive view maintenance. This work
can be easily extended to streams, where sliding windows semantics
be nicely incorporated. There are many applications of recursive
view maintenance over streams, such as distributed recursive
queries in declarative network, region-based transitive closure
queries in sensor networks and so on.
