<h3>Meetings</h3>

<h4>Fall 2008</h4>
<p>This meeting was held December 8 and 9 at the University of
Pennsylvania.  Discussions revolved around piratical applications of
the theoretical developments already achieved for manifest security.</p>
<p>
Main presentations:
<ul>
  <li>Aaron Bohannon discussed noninterference for reactive
      programming languages.</li>
  <li>Deepak Garg demonstrated a prototype file system using proof carrying
      carrying authorization.</li>
  <li>Avijit Kumar demonstrated a proof-carrying extension to ML5</li>
<ul>
</p>

<h4>Summer 2008</h4>
<p>
This meeting was held June 28 and 29 at Carnegie Mellon.  The topics of
discussion included refining the threat model for web browsers;
updates on ongoing work; and technical issues surrounding proof carrying access
control, information flow, and computational models for web scripting.

    presentation</a> and demo implementing a file system
    using an authorization logic for access control.</li>
  <li>Tom Murphy told as about ML5.  For more information see the presentation

      thesis defense</a>.
    </li>
  <li>We sketched out a straw language design for web programming using
    dependent types for access control and based on purely functional
    maps between page states.</li> 
</ul>
