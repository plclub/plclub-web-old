<p>We issue here a set of challenge problems, dubbed the POPLmark
Challenge, chosen to exercise many aspects of programming languages that
are known to be difficult to formalize: variable binding at both term
and type levels, syntactic forms with variable numbers of components
(including binders), and proofs demanding complex induction principles.
Our goal is to push the state of the art in formalizing programming
language metatheory to the point where the technology is <a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/proj/plclub/mmm/">usable by the
masses</a>.</p>

<p>Overtime, we expect to post here proposed solutions to the challenge
and discussions about those solutions.  General tools and libraries that
come out of the challenge will be posted at a companion site on <a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/proj/plclub/mmm/">mechanized metatheory
for the masses</a>.  We may also post additional problems for the
challenge when it becomes evident that the current set of problems are
no longer challenging enough.</p>

<h2><a id="problems"></a>The Challenge Problems</h2>

<p>Our challenge problems are taken from the basic metatheory of System
F<sub>&lt;:</sub>. This system is formed by enriching the types and
terms of System F with a subtype relation, refining universal
quantifiers to carry subtyping constraints, and adding records, record
subtyping, and record patterns.  The challenge problems are currently:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Transitivity of the algorithmic subtyping relation</li>
   <li>Type safety</li>
   <li>Testing and animating with respect to the semantics</li>
</ol>

<p>The official description, along with background information
concerning the design of the challenge, is available for download: [<a
href="poplmark.ps">PostScript</a>] [<a
href="poplmark.ps.gz">Gzipped&nbsp;PostScript</a>] [<a
href="poplmark.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>

<p>The F<sub>&lt;:</sub> interpreter for Challenege 3 is currently in
need of work, but a preliminary implementation, written in <a
href="http://www.ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is available: [<a
href="fsubimpl.tar.gz">tar.gz</a>].</p>

<p>Proposed solutions should be sent to someplace.  (We'll figure this
out eventually...)</p>
