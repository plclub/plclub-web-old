Is your favorite programming language the best? Does it lead to better and 
faster programs? Does it make programs easy to write and modify? Are you 
and your friends the best programmers in the world?<p> 

Then prove it!<p>

All programmers are invited to enter the contest, either
individually or in teams. The contest offers direct, head-to-head
comparison of language technology and programming skill. We have a range of
 prizes including  <b>unlimited bragging rights</b> for the winners. The
prizes will be awarded at <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/icfp04/">ICFP
2004</a> in Snowbird, Utah this September.<p> </td></tr>

On Friday 4th June at 16:00 UTC (12:00 noon EDT), the programming task will be
published on this web site. Teams will have 72 hours to write and submit a 
program to perform this task.

<p>

The programming contest is being conducted by ICFP, which
has a desire to promote functional languages. However, rather
than debate the definition of a &quot;functional programming
language,&quot; we will accept submissions implemented using 
<i>any language whatsoever</i>. <p>
