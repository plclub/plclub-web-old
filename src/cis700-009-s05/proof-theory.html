  <h2>Strength of the Logical System</h2>

  <p>Depending on the particular rules and connectives chosen, any of the
  following styles of rule systems may be used to define minimal,
  intuitionistic, or classical versions of propositional or predicate logic.
  The strength of the logic refers to the set of formulas that are provable in
  the system rather than the method of proof.</p>

  <h2>Proof Systems</h2>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Rule system</th>
      <th>Primary characteristic</th>
      <th>Proof trees with assumptions at leaves ("non-sequent-style")</th>
      <th>Proof trees with assumptions managed at each node
        ("sequent-style")</th>
      <th>Proofs as lists</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hilbert system</td>
      <td>Many axioms, but only one inference rule: <em>modus ponens</em></td>
      <td>Typical presentation</td>
      <td>Possible, but not typical because nothing interesting is done to the
        context of assumptions as it is carried along</td>
      <td rowspan="3">This historically preceded thinking of proofs as trees
        and would have been the original method of doing Hilbert-style proofs;
        it is trivally applicable to any rule system since there is no
        substantial difference from trees: do a topological sort of the nodes
        of the proof tree and use pointers to identify parent nodes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Natural deduction</td>
      <td>Rules divided into introduction and elimination rules</td>
      <td>A common presentation; originated with Jaskowski (1929); not
        extensively used in proof theory until Prawitz (1960s); perfect
        isomorphism with simply-typed lambda-calculus</td>
      <td>Also common; originated with Gentzen (1935)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sequent calculus</td>
      <td>Rules divided into left and right introduction rules</td>
      <td>Does not make sense since left rules affect the context of
        assumptions</td>
      <td>The original method (Gentzen, 1935)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Further Distinctions</h2>

  <p>The management of contexts at the nodes of the proof tree in sequent-style
  proofs allows for two more dimensions of flexibility:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The mathematical structure used to hold assumptions, e.g. sets,
    multisets, lists, maps</li>
    <li>Additive vs. multiplicative contexts (multiplicative much more
    common)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Furthermore, these choices interact with the rule system because one may
  want or need to add structural rules depending on the choices made.</p>

  <p>Finally, it is interesting to note that in order to define a sequent-style
  natural deduction system that is isomorphic to the non-sequent-style system
  that Prawitz used, one must choose among the above options carefully.  In
  particular, the most simple and obvious ones won't work.</p>
